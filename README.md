# Problem Statement Overview
This repository contains the code my team SPPU_AASM's submission for the WANLP Arsarcasm shared task 2021. The shared task consists of two research statements described below.

**Subtask 1 (Sarcasm Detection):** Identifying whether a tweet is sarcastic or not, this is a binary classification task.

**Subtask 2 (Sentiment Analysis):** Identifying the sentiment of a tweet and assigning one of three labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral), multiclass classification task.


# Proposed System
The proposed system is deep multi-chanel hybrid model which combines the word representations from pretrained AraBERT (A transformer-based language model trained on Arabic Wikipedia and news corpora), and pretrained Mazajak word embeddings (word2vec-based static word vectors trained on Twitter).
