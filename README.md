# Arabic-Sentiment-Identification
This repository contains the code my team SPPU_AASM's submission for the WANLP Arsarcasm shared task 2021. The shared task consists of two research statements described below.

**Subtask 2 (Sentiment Analysis):** Identifying the sentiment of a tweet and assigning one of three labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral), multiclass classification task.
